# College-Management-System

College Management System is a simple desktop application developed using C# Language. The Project is based on the concept of managing students record. Talking about the system, a user has to pass through a login system for using its features. A user can record information by providing student’s name, mother’s name, gender, address, contact details, standard and so on.

The user can also easily upgrade semester records of selected students. It also contains fees transaction for the student. The user can list all the available students or simply search individually by providing registration id. In order to add teachers record, the user has to provide name, gender, surname, contact details, standard, programming subject, year and so on. The last feature of this project is about removing student’s record, which can be done by entering registration id.
